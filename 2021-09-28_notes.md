# BrainFlow Metric: 

Concentration/relaxation metric in OpenBCI GUI, based on pre-trained
classifiers from the brainflow library.
Link: https://docs.openbci.com/Software/OpenBCISoftware/GUIWidgets/
	
Looks at all data, outputs a single float between 0 and 1 as the metric.

Two metrics:
 - Relaxation: Delta, Theta and Alpha brainwaves
 - Concentration: Beta and Gamma brainwaves

We can use this to re-implement the Focus Widget in the OpenBCI GUI in python 
using the brainflow library --> control axis of rotation of the labyrint with 
the focus metric.
