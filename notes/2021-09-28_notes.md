# BrainFlow Focus Metric: 

Concentration/relaxation metric in OpenBCI GUI, based on pre-trained
classifiers from the brainflow library.
	
Looks at all input data, outputs a single float between 0 and 1 as the metric.

Two metrics:
 - Relaxation: Mainly delta, theta and alpha brainwaves
 - Concentration: Mainly beta and gamma brainwaves

We can use this to re-implement the Focus Widget in the OpenBCI GUI in python 
using the brainflow library --> control axis of rotation of the labyrint with 
the focus metric.

**Potential problems**: Not sure if/how this can handle two separate, simultaneous users.
